A userscript that allows you to view Markdown files directly in your browser. It automatically detects `.md` files and renders them as HTML, providing a more readable format.

You can switch between serif/sans-serif and system/light/dark mode via the Tampermonkey menu.

_Note: To view local Markdown files, you need to allow Tampermonkey to access local files. This can be done in the Chrome extension settings by enabling the "Allow access to file URLs" option._
